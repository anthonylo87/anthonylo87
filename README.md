Hi there, Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me, I am a FP&A analyst turnedd full-stack software engineer. I made the transition into software engineering because I was drawn to the technical challenges presented at my prior roles, and wanted a more personal role in architecting these solutions.

Most recently I co-developed an open source product called DenoGres [[repo]](https://github.com/open-source-labs/DenoGres), an open-source ORM Mapping tool designed for PostgreSQL within the Deno runtime, aimed at simplifying development involving PostgreSQL databases.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy drinking copious amounts of coffee and traveling (most recently having traveled to Italy, Japan, Thailand, Maldives and Singapore, all in one go!)
